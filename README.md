I took on the challenge of working with the Tokyo Olympics Data sourced from Kaggle. 🏅 Leveraging a variety of techniques, I successfully collected the data through methods like forking from Git, utilizing Kaggle's API, and accessing it from local storage. This was just the beginning of the adventure!

🔗 Using Azure Data Factory, I orchestrated the entire data flow, ensuring seamless extraction and loading processes. The Tokyo Olympics data found its home in Azure Data Storage Gen 2, setting the stage for further transformations.

✨ Harnessing the power of Databricks and Spark, I delved into intricate data transformations, optimizing table schemas and structure. I even had the opportunity to explore Azure Synapse, where I created a high-performance database to house the refined data. This step was pivotal in setting the groundwork for efficient querying and analysis.

🔐 Managing permissions became a vital part of the process. With Azure Active Directory and app registration, I ensured secure access between Azure Data Storage and Databricks, enabling a streamlined and secure data pipeline.

📊 The journey reached its peak with Power BI, where I brought the data to life through insightful visualizations. 📈
